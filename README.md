# DLM

Dynamic linear models (DLMs) are state-space models which generalize linear regression to allow analysis and forecasting of data acquired over time. The Kalman filter is the most well known case of a DLM. DLMs are built and analyzed under a Bayesian paradigm.

This repository includes a set of functions to implement univariate and multivariate DLMs.
