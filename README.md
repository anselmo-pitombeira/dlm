# DLM

Dynamic linear models (DLMs) are state-space models which generalize linear regression to allow analysis and forecasting of data acquired over time. The Kalman filter is the most well known case of a DLM. DLMs are built and analyzed under a Bayesian paradigm.

This repository includes a set of functions to implement univariate and multivariate DLMs.

The code in this repository is still highly experimental and at an initial stage of development. Documentation consists of comments in the source code. We plan to make the code clearer and improve documentation over time.
